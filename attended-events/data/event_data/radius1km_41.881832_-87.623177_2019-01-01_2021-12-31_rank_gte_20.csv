c6ur3UBPzP575G4bgF,My America: T Kira Madden & Rowan Hisayo Buchanan,community,"In conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, join us for an evening with writers T KIRA MADDEN and ROWAN HISAYO BUCHANAN, who’ll discuss the Go Home! anthology, wherein Asian diasporic writers imagine “home” in the twenty-first century through an array of fiction, memoir, and poetry. Buchanan edited the anthology while Madden contributed to it.

This program is part of the Jeanne M. & John W. Rowe program series, a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

T KIRA MADDEN’S debut memoir Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls is a story about trauma and forgiveness, families of blood and affinity, both crooked and beautiful. Her parents battled with drug and alcohol addictions, leaving Madden virtually alone to face a culture of assault and objectification. Madden is also featured in the anthology Go Home! which brings together Asian diasporic writers that showcases the intimacies of individuals figuring out what it means to belong.

ROWAN HISAYO BUCHANAN is a prolific writer of British, Japanese, Chinese and American Heritage. Editor of the Go Home! anthology, and author of Harmless Like You and Starling Days, her short work has appeared in several places including Granta, Guernica, The Guardian, The Harvard Review, and NPR’s Selected Shorts.",7200,2020-03-12 23:30:00+00:00,2020-03-13 01:30:00+00:00,,2020-02-20 05:15:13+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

F3QfkAC9xZpvDj5pnC,My America: Sawako Nakayasu,community,"In conjunction with the AWM’s special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we are pleased to present SAWAKO NAKAYASU, an artist working with language, performance, and translation – separately and in various combinations. She has lived mostly in the US and Japan, briefly in France and China, and translates from Japanese. This convergence of cultures, countries, and languages gives Nakayasu a unique perspective on writing and translating across borders.

This program is part of the Jeanne M. & John W. Rowe program series, a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American.

Born in Japan, translator and writer Sawako Nakayasu’s work lives at the intersection cultures, countries and languages. She is co-editor, with Lisa Samuels, of A Transpacific Poetics, a gathering of poetry and poetics that re-maps identity and locale in modes of argumentation, resituated genres, and textual innovations. She is also the author of several poetry collections, including The Ants (2014), Texture Notes (2010), Hurry Home Honey (2009), and So We Have Been Given Time Or (2004), which was selected for the Verse Prize by Ann Lauterbach. Mouth: Eats Color—Sagawa Chika Translations, Anti-Translations, & Originals (2011) is a book of both translation and original work. Nakayasu teaches at Brown University.",7200,2020-03-04 00:30:00+00:00,2020-03-04 02:30:00+00:00,,2020-01-29 03:17:48+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

gxmos3dFTHcvMZMcjY,Watson Adventures’ Wizard School Scavenger Hunt,community,"Join Watson Adventures on a unique scavenger hunt for Harry Potter fans!

Follow in the footsteps of young wizards on a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago, in search of art that echoes characters, places and enchanted objects in the famed Harry Potter books and movies. Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, centaurs and unicorns like those you’d see in the Forbidden Forest, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor. Wizards and muggles alike can play and enjoy this hunt.

djrMqBrvwaTgEbQLoN,My America: David Treuer,community,"In conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, join us for an evening with bestselling author DAVID TREUER, an Ojibwe Indian from Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota. Treuer’s latest work, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, is a sweeping history — and counter-narrative — of Native American life from the Wounded Knee massacre to the present and was a finalist for the 2019 National Book Award.

This program is part of the Jeanne M. & John W. Rowe program series, a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American.

Bestselling author DAVID TREUER is an Ojibwe Indian from Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota. He is the recipient of a Pushcart Prize, two Minnesota Book Awards, and fellowships from the NEH, Bush Foundation, and the Guggenheim Foundation. He divides his time between his home on the Leech Lake Reservation and Los Angeles, where he is a Professor of English at USC.

The son of Robert Treuer, an Austrian Jew and Holocaust survivor and Margaret Seelye Treuer, a tribal court judge, David Treuer grew up on Leech Lake Reservation. After graduating from high school he attended Princeton University where he wrote two senior theses — one in anthropology and one in creative writing — and where he worked with Toni Morrison, Paul Muldoon, and Joanna Scott. Treuer graduated in 1992 and published his first novel, Little, in 1995. He received his PhD in anthropology and published his second novel, The Hiawatha, in 1999. His third novel The Translation of Dr Apelles and a book of criticism, Native American Fiction: A User’s Manual appeared in 2006. The Translation of Dr Apelles was named a Best Book of the Year by the Washington Post, Time Out, and City Pages. He published his first major work of nonfiction, Rez Life, in 2012. His next novel, Prudence, was published by Riverhead Books in 2015.

VcX3EjgDzss47xttAa,Nicholas Buccola: The Fire Is Upon Us,community,"Writer Nicholas Buccola presents his new book The Fire Is Upon Us, which shows how the iconic clash between the civil rights firebrand James Baldwin and the father of modern conservatism William F. Buckley, Jr. continues to illuminate America’s racial divide.

About the The Fire Is Upon Us:

On February 18, 1965, an overflowing crowd packed the Cambridge Union in Cambridge, England, to witness a historic televised debate between James Baldwin, the leading literary voice of the civil rights movement, and William F. Buckley Jr., a fierce critic of the movement and America’s most influential conservative intellectual. The topic was “the American dream is at the expense of the American Negro,” and no one who has seen the debate can soon forget it. Nicholas Buccola’s The Fire Is Upon Us is the first book to tell the full story of the event, the radically different paths that led Baldwin and Buckley to it, the controversies that followed, and how the debate and the decades-long clash between the men continues to illuminate America’s racial divide today.

Born in New York City only fifteen months apart, the Harlem-raised Baldwin and the privileged Buckley could not have been more different, but they both rose to the height of American intellectual life during the civil rights movement. By the time they met in Cambridge, Buckley was determined to sound the alarm about a man he considered an “eloquent menace.” For his part, Baldwin viewed Buckley as a deluded reactionary whose popularity revealed the sickness of the American soul. The stage was set for an epic confrontation that pitted Baldwin’s call for a moral revolution in race relations against Buckley’s unabashed elitism and implicit commitment to white supremacy.

A remarkable story of race and the American dream, The Fire Is Upon Us reveals the deep roots and lasting legacy of a conflict that continues to haunt our politics.

NICHOLAS BUCCOLA is a writer, lecturer, and teacher who specializes in the area of American political thought. He is the author of The Fire Is upon Us: James Baldwin, William F.

That, along with her natural approach to phrasing and time, is truly what invites her audience in at every performance. Wayne Messmer, professional speaker, singer, broadcaster and Chicago jazz WDCB radio host notes “One thing about Angel is her tremendous stage presence, and then she delivers this magnificent talent. It’s obvious when people love what they do and I think the important thing about her is that there isn’t a song writer on this planet who wouldn’t love to have their song sung by Angel.”
In Chicago, Angel has been spotlighted on numerous morning shows, such as ABC 7’s Windy City Live and FOX 32’s Good Day Chicago and competed in top 5 standing in several televised vocal competitions. Recently she was featured on WGN-TV performing “God Bless America” and the National Anthem for the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.

ojrRtRxzV9upSm6KhH,Danez Smith: Homie,community,"Poet DANEZ SMITH presents their new collection Homie. Rooted in the loss of one of Smith’s close friends, this book comes out of the search for joy and intimacy within a nation where both can seem scarce and getting scarcer. Smith is joined by writer and performance poet BRITTENEY ROSE BLACK KAPRI.

More about Homie:

Smith is back with their highly anticipated third collection, Homie, a magnificent anthem about the saving grace of friendship. In poems of rare power and generosity, Smith acknowledges that in a country overrun by violence, xenophobia, and disparity, and in a body defined by race, queerness, and diagnosis, it can be hard to survive, even harder to remember reasons for living. But then the phone lights up, or a shout comes up to the window, and family—blood and chosen—arrives with just the right food and some redemption. Part friendship diary, part bright elegy, part war cry, Homie is written for friends: for Danez’s, for yours.

“An electrifying, unabashedly queer ode to friendship and community…Smith is a visionary polyglot with a fearless voice.” —Publishers Weekly, starred review

“This book reads as gospel, as righteous text that carves a religion out of friendship…Blessed be Danez Smith, for allowing us that closeness…Smith holds genius in them, and we are lucky that they choose to share it with us so abundantly.” —Fatimah Asghar

“Danez Smith has always been the most talented voice of our generation, but it’s here, in their third collection, that their virtuosic abilities are matched by the ambitiousness of their heart.” —Franny Choi

DANEZ SMITH is a Black, Queer, Poz writer & performer from St. Paul, MN. Danez is the author of “Don’t Call Us Dead” (Graywolf Press, 2017), winner of the Forward Prize for Best Collection, the Midwest Booksellers Choice Award, and a finalist for the National Book Award, and “[insert] boy” (YesYes Books, 2014), winner of the Kate Tufts Discovery Award and the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Poetry.

PwLxtcWiza6vi5WesA,Paul Laurence Dunbar: Beyond the Mask,performing-arts,"Filmmaker FREDERICK LEWIS presents his feature length documentary Paul Laurence Dunbar: Beyond The Mask, a film about the life and legacy of the first African American writer to gain international fame. Lewis will introduce the film and lead a post-screening discussion.

About Paul Laurence Dunbar:

Born to former slaves in Dayton, Ohio, where he was boyhood friends with the Wright Brothers, Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) is best remembered for his poem “We Wear The Mask” and for lines from “Sympathy” that became the title of Maya Angelou’s famous autobiography “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.”  A clip of Angelou reciting Dunbar’s poem is featured in the film.

Dunbar’s story strongly reflects the African American experience around the turn of the century. The man abolitionist Frederick Douglass called “the most promising young colored man in America” wrote widely published essays critical of Jim Crow laws, lynching and what was commonly called “The Negro Problem.” To earn a living, however, he also wrote poems and short stories in “Plantation dialect” and contributed lyrics for Broadway musicals that bordered on blackface minstrelsy.

More than eight years in the making, “Beyond The Mask” received major funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Writer, director and co-producer FREDERICK LEWIS is a professor in the School of Media Arts & Studies at Ohio University. His previous documentaries have been seen on PBS stations throughout the U.S. and been screened at more than 90 cultural/educational venues, including the National Gallery of Art, the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, the Lake Placid Film Forum and the Explorers Club in NYC. Professor Lewis is a recipient of the Presidential Teacher Award, Ohio University’s highest honor for transformative teaching, curriculum innovation and mentoring. He has served as a Fulbright Specialist in Hungary and has taught or lectured in England, Germany, France, Malaysia and Vietnam.",10800,2020-02-07 00:30:00+00:00,2020-02-07 03:30:00+00:00,,2020-01-15 03:18:54+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'movie', 'performing-arts']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

ZuGW5wHtMKJWeHnBRo,My America: Layla Saad,community,"In conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we present a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Join us in welcoming speaker, writer, podcaster and racial justice advocate LAYLA SAAD, whose hit workbook Me and White Supremacy teaches people how to dismantle privilege within themselves so they can stop (even unconsciously) from inflicting damage on people of color and help other white people, in turn, to do better too.

About Me and White Supremacy:

In the summer of 2018, thousands of people from around the world were galvanized by Layla Saad’s #meandwhitesupremacy challenge, examining and owning responsibility for the ways in which they uphold white supremacy. Over 80,000 people downloaded her guide to the movement, Me and White Supremacy Workbook in the space of just six months. And now, that guide is becoming a published book.

Me and White Supremacy: A 28-Day Challenge to Combat Racism, Change the World, and Become a Good Ancestor leads readers through a journey of understanding their white privilege and participation in white supremacy, so that they can stop (often unconsciously) inflicting damage on black, indigenous and people of color, and in turn, help other white people do better, too. The book goes beyond the original workbook by adding more historical and cultural contexts, sharing moving stories and anecdotes, and includes expanded definitions, examples, and further resources.

LAYLA SAAD is a globally respected writer, speaker and podcast host on the topics of race, identity, leadership, personal transformation and social change. As an East African, Arab, British, Black, Muslim woman who was born and grew up in the West, and lives in the Middle East, Layla has always sat at a unique intersection of identities from which she is able to draw rich and intriguing perspectives. Layla’s work is driven by her powerful desire to ‘become a good ancestor’ and to live and work in ways that leave a legacy of healing and liberation for those who will come after she is gone.

Layla is unapologetically confronting the oppressive systems of white supremacy and patriarchy, while offering important teachings and tools for transforming consciousness, cultivating personal anti-racism practice and taking responsibility for our individual and collective healing.

Me and White Supremacy is Layla’s first book. Initially offered for free following an Instagram challenge under the same name, the best-selling digital Me And White Supremacy Workbook was downloaded by close to ninety thousand people around the world in the space of six months, before becoming a traditionally published book. Layla’s work has been brought into homes, educational institutions and workplaces around the world that are seeking to create personal and collective change.

Layla earned her Bachelor of Law degree from Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. She lives in Doha, Qatar with her husband, Sam, and two children, Maya and Mohamed.

RCzE7SLSNqrstrzRvT,My America: Pablo Cartaya,community,"In conjunction with AWM’s special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we present a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Join us in welcoming bestselling author and actor PABLO CARTAYA, who’ll discuss what it’s like writing as a Cuban-American and his newest book, Each Tiny Spark, a deeply moving middle grade novel about a daughter and father finding their way back to each other in the face of their changing family and community.

About Each Tiny Spark:

Emilia Torres has a wandering mind. It’s hard for her to follow along at school, and sometimes she forgets to do what her mom or abuela asks. But she remembers what matters: a time when her family was whole and home made sense. Emilia expects that her life will get back to normal when Dad returns from deployment. Instead, it unravels. Dad shuts himself in the garage to work on an old car. Emilia peeks in on him daily, mesmerized by the sparks flying from his welder. One day, Dad calls Emilia over to take a closer look. Then, he teaches her how to weld. And over time, flickers of her old dad reappear. But as Emilia finds a way to repair the relationship with her father at home, her community ruptures with some of her classmates, like her best friend, Gus, at the center of the conflict. Each Tiny Spark is a tender story about asking big questions and being brave enough to reckon with the answers.

PABLO CARTAYA is an award-winning author whose books include the critically acclaimed middle grade novels The Epic Fail of Arturo Zamora (a 2018 Pura Belpre Honor Book) and Marcus Vega Doesn’t Speak Spanish. His next novel, Each Tiny Spark will debut on the new Kokila Penguin/Random House Imprint, which focuses on publishing diverse books for children and young adults. Pablo has acted on stage and television (notably co-starring on NBC’s “Will & Grace”) and frequently gives talks around the country on writing, reading, and multilingualism. He holds an MFA from Vermont College of Fine Arts and currently serves as faculty at Sierra Nevada College’s MFA in Writing.

Awards and Honors include: American Library Association’s Pura Belpré Honor, Audie Award Finalist for Middle Grade Audiobook of the Year (for narration and title), Cybils Award Finalist, Texas Lone Star Reading List, Publisher’s Weekly Flying Start, and the 2018 Thurber House Writer-in-Residence.",7200,2020-02-05 00:30:00+00:00,2020-02-05 02:30:00+00:00,,2020-01-12 03:18:47+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

amJ5NmmnjvdLVq5kmf,My America: Julissa Arce,community,"In conjunction with AWM’s special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we present a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Join us in welcoming CNBC and Crooked Media contributor JULISSA ARCE, whose memoirs My (Underground) American Dream and the YA version Someone Like Me trace her journey from an undocumented Mexican immigrant to an executive position at Goldman Sachs.

About Someone Like Me:

Born in the picturesque town of Taxco, Mexico, Julissa Arce was left behind for months at a time with her two sisters, a nanny, and her grandma while her parents worked tirelessly in America in hopes of building a home and providing a better life for their children. That is, until her parents brought Julissa to Texas to live with them. From then on, Julissa secretly lived as an undocumented immigrant, went on to become a scholarship winner and an honors college graduate, and climbed the ladder to become a vice president at Goldman Sachs.

This moving, at times heartbreaking, but always inspiring story will show young readers that anything is possible. Julissa’s story provides a deep look into the little-understood world of a new generation of undocumented immigrants in the United States today–kids who live next door, sit next to you in class, or may even be one of your best friends.

JULISSA ARCE is a political commentator, speaker, writer and best-selling author of Someone Like Me and My (Underground) American Dream, which is currently being developed as a television series with producer and actor America Ferrera. She was named one of People en Español’s 25 Most Powerful Women of 2017. She is a leading voice in the fight for social justice, immigrant rights and education equality, serving as co-founder of the Ascend Educational Fund (AEF) and on the board of directors of the National Immigration Law Center. She is a contributor for Crooked Media, CNBC and a host for Crooked Conversations. She was officially sworn in as an American citizen in August of 2014.",7200,2020-01-24 00:30:00+00:00,2020-01-24 02:30:00+00:00,,2020-01-05 03:26:49+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

hFZy4gTHkHMX5NQtNe,My America: Isabel Ibañez,community,"In conjunction with AWM’s special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we present a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Join us in welcoming the daughter of Bolivian immigrants, ISABEL IBAÑEZ, whose debut novel Woven in Moonlight is a lush tapestry of magic, romance, and revolución, drawing inspiration from Bolivian politics and history.

About Woven in Moonlight:

Ximena is the decoy Condesa, a stand-in for the last remaining Illustrian royal. Her people lost everything when the usurper, Atoc, used an ancient relic to summon ghosts and drive the Illustrians from La Ciudad. Now Ximena’s motivated by her insatiable thirst for revenge, and her rare ability to spin thread from moonlight. When Atoc demands the real Condesa’s hand in marriage, it’s Ximena’s duty to go in her stead. She relishes the chance, as Illustrian spies have reported that Atoc’s no longer carrying his deadly relic.

If Ximena can find it, she can return the true aristócrata to their rightful place. She hunts for the relic, using her weaving ability to hide messages in tapestries for the resistance. But when a masked vigilante, a warm-hearted princess, and a thoughtful healer challenge Ximena, her mission becomes more complicated. There could be a way to overthrow the usurper without starting another war, but only if Ximena turns her back on revenge—and her Condesa.

In addition to writing, ISABEL IBAÑEZ is an award winning designer, illustrator, mom to a golden-doodle named Piper, and a Pitch Wars class ’15 Alum. By day, she designs greeting cards and by night she writes YA fantasies featuring amazing food and strong Latina characters who are often running for their lives.

This program is part of the Jeanne M. and John W. Rowe Program Series, in conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today. Books will be sold and signed at the event.",0,2020-01-22 00:30:00+00:00,2020-01-22 00:30:00+00:00,,2020-01-04 03:59:27+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art.

America, 1947. Despite hard choices and even harder knocks, Joe and Kate Keller are a success story. They have built a home, raised two sons and established a thriving business.

But nothing lasts forever and their contented lives, already shadowed by the loss of their eldest boy to war, are about to shatter. With the return of a figure from the past, long buried truths are forced to the surface and the price of their American dream is laid bare.

Jeremy Herrin (NT Live: This House) directs the cast, which also includes Jenna Coleman (Victoria), and Colin Morgan (Merlin) alongside Bessie Carter, Oliver Johnstone, Kayla Meikle and Sule Rimi.

National Theatre Live captures live performances from the UK. Over ten years, NT Live has shown over 80 theatre productions in 3500 venues worldwide, reaching an overall audience of nearly 9 million people. NT Live currently screens in 2500 venues across 65 countries.

National Theatre Live is the closest thing audiences have to experiencing the feeling of actually sitting in the theater. Broadcasts retain the feeling of a live performance and though each broadcast is filmed in front of a live audience in the theatre, cameras are carefully positioned throughout the auditorium to ensure that cinema audiences get the ‘best seat in the house.’",9000,2020-01-19 01:00:00+00:00,2020-01-19 03:30:00+00:00,,2019-12-22 04:57:33+00:00,"['movie', 'performing-arts']","[-87.628171, 41.884929]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': 'BuNgMhhjFrZYdJJ6V5Hjhv', 'name': 'Gene Siskel Film Center', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '164 North State Street\nChicago, IL 60601\nUnited States of America'}]",60,26,34,

bsSEcqnjzsAayXzM9D,My America: Susan Muaddi Darraj,community,"In conjunction with AWM’s special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today, we present a series of conversations with leading contemporary writers about their latest work and their thoughts on themes of identity, home, belonging and the meaning of what it is to be American. Join us in welcoming award-winning writer SUSAN MUADDI DARRAJ.

Darraj’s short story collection A Curious Land: Stories from Home won the AWP Grace Paley Prize for Short Fiction, the 2016 Arab American Book Award, a 2016 American Book Award and was shortlisted for a Palestine Book Award. Her forthcoming children’s chapter book series, Farah Rocks, tells the story of Farah Hajjar, a smart, funny, and brave Palestinian-American girl who loves three things: her little brother Samir, Greek mythology, and of course her rock collection. In this 4-book series, Farah faces all of life’s challenges: bullies, school drama, and even problems with her best friend.

This program is part of the Jeanne M. and John W. Rowe Program Series, in conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today. Books will be sold and signed at the event.",7200,2020-01-15 00:30:00+00:00,2020-01-15 02:30:00+00:00,,2019-12-22 04:33:26+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor.  The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art. Kids must be accompanied by an adult, but all-adult teams can compete separately. Price includes museum admission. Advance purchase is required. Questions?

rMhLQ5m67bcRHuNgfG,My America: Dominic A. Pacyga,performing-arts,"With American Warsaw, award-winning historian and Polish American DOMINIC A. PACYGA chronicles more than a century of immigration, and later emigration back to Poland, showing how the community has continually redefined what it means to be Polish in Chicago. Pacyga will be joined by bestselling writer SARA PARETSKY. This program is part of the Jeanne M. and John W. Rowe Program Series, in conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About American Warsaw:

Pacyga takes us from the Civil War era until today, focusing on how three major waves of immigrants, refugees, and fortune seekers shaped and then redefined the Polonia. Pacyga also traces the movement of Polish immigrants from the peasantry to the middle class and from urban working-class districts dominated by major industries to suburbia. He documents Polish Chicago’s alignments and divisions: with other Chicago ethnic groups; with the Catholic Church; with unions, politicians, and city hall; and even among its own members. And he explores the ever-shifting sense of Polskość, or “Polishness.”

Today Chicago is slowly being eclipsed by other Polish immigrant centers, but it remains a vibrant—and sometimes contentious—heart of the Polish American experience. American Warsaw is a sweeping story that expertly depicts a people who are deeply connected to their historical home and, at the same time, fiercely proud of their adopted city. As Pacyga writes, “While we were Americans, we also considered ourselves to be Poles. In that strange Chicago ethnic way, there was no real difference between the two.”

DOMINIC A. PACYGA is professor emeritus of history in the Department of Humanities, History, and Social Sciences at Columbia College Chicago. His books include Polish Immigrants and Industrial Chicago: Workers on the South Side, 1880–1922; Chicago: A Biography; and Slaughterhouse: Chicago’s Union Stock Yard and the World It Made, all from the University of Chicago Press. Pacyga is the 2014 Mieczyslaw Haiman Award winner for exceptional and sustained contribution to the study of Polish Americans.",0,2019-12-11 00:30:00+00:00,2019-12-11 00:30:00+00:00,,2019-11-09 03:17:47+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'performing-arts']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

Zo3iRuYRDEEamSr6be,My America: Rebecca Deng,performing-arts,"Acclaimed speaker REBECCA DENG tells her incredible true story to freedom in her first book, What They Meant for Evil. A lyrical, captivating portrait of a child hurled into wartime, and how through divine intervention, she came to America and found a new life full of joy, hope, and redemption. This program is part of the Jeanne M. and John W. Rowe Program Series, in conjunction with our special exhibit My America: Immigrant and Refugee Writers Today.

About What They Meant for Evil:

One of the first unaccompanied refugee children to enter the United States in 2000, after South Sudan’s second civil war took the lives of most of her family, Rebecca’s story begins in the late 1980s when, at the age of four, her village was attacked and she had to escape. What They Meant for Evil is the account of that unimaginable journey. With the candor and purity of a child, Rebecca recalls how she endured fleeing from gunfire, suffering through hunger and strength-sapping illnesses, dodging life-threatening predators—lions, snakes, crocodiles, and soldiers alike—that dogged her footsteps, and grappling with a war that stole her childhood.

REBECCA DENG, of South Sudan’s Dinka tribe, is one of the 89 Lost Girls who came to the United States in 2000 as a refugee after living eight years in Kakuma Refugee Camp in northern Kenya. The violence she experienced as a child during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005) has given her a deep empathy for children and young adults who face similar situations today. She became a US citizen in 2006.

Today Rebecca is an international speaker and advocate for women and children who have been traumatized and victimized by war. She has spoken at the United Nations and served as a Refugee Congress delegate at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Washington D.C. She also led a sixty-five person team of referendum workers at the 2011 Out of the Country Voting Center for the South Sudanese Independence Referendum. She worked with the American Bible Society’s Mission Trauma Healing program, formerly called She’s My Sister.",0,2019-12-07 00:30:00+00:00,2019-12-07 00:30:00+00:00,,2019-11-08 09:56:12+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'performing-arts']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

Today’s headlines print the pain found in West Garfield Park, but you can’t judge a neighborhood by its coverage. Out here, stories of positivity, innocence, joy and hope exist beyond what we read on the front page.

There are no headlines for the teenage poets or entertainers. We don’t see the piano prodigy taking center stage on the nightly news. Yet, these great stories exist block by block and flourish within the walls of Off The Street Club.

Through the power of creativity, we challenge and redefine what it means to be shot in West Garfield Park — and use the legendary talent of photographer Sandro Miller to showcase the heart, joy, passions and dreams that pulse through our West Side community.

Your generosity will do much more than fund our after-school program. It will hold a mirror to the media, showcasing the humanity missing from the headlines and working to push for a more positive perception of West Garfield Park. With your help, we can create a brighter future.

KGggAPVPJF9fjtSc2P,Watson Adventures’ Wizard School Scavenger Hunt for Harry Potter Fans,community,"Follow in the footsteps of young wizards on a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago, in search of art that echoes characters, places and enchanted objects in the famed Harry Potter books and movies. Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor.  The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art. Kids must be accompanied by an adult, but all-adult teams can compete separately. Price includes museum admission. Advance purchase is required. Questions?

The time's up for siloed thinking and siloed structures. Outdated products and clunky service are no longer acceptable.

Survival and future success rely on embedding speed to address customer challenges faster than the competition, merging innovative technology with real-time data to transform product, underwriting, customer experience and claims.

oQ4wDePiegsuud9ruX,Everest/Aleko,performing-arts,"A modern masterpiece and a Romantic Russian gem come together in a massive double-bill.

Moby-Dick stars Andrew Bidlack (Greenhorn) and Aleksey Bogdanov (Starbuck) return to the COT stage in the musical event of the season. Over 150 choristers join a full orchestra onstage to bring Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s critically acclaimed Everest and Rachmaninov’s beautiful Aleko to Chicago for the first time.

In Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s Everest, based on the true story chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s critically acclaimed book Into Thin Air, a team of climbers set out to summit the monolithic mountain. Plagued by the ghosts of those claimed by the journey, they endeavor to join the hallowed ranks of adventurers to have conquered the peak.

In Rachmaninov’s Aleko, a man abandons a life in Russian society to join his love, the fiercely independent Zemfira, and her free spirited camp of Romani travelers. When Zemfira refuses to settle down with just one lover, Aleko is faced with a choice: adapt to this new life, or face tragic consequences.

PWHudgz6T4yB3onu57,Everest/Aleko,performing-arts,"A modern masterpiece and a Romantic Russian gem come together in a massive double-bill.

Moby-Dick stars Andrew Bidlack (Greenhorn) and Aleksey Bogdanov (Starbuck) return to the COT stage in the musical event of the season. Over 150 choristers join a full orchestra onstage to bring Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s critically acclaimed Everest and Rachmaninov’s beautiful Aleko to Chicago for the first time.

In Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s Everest, based on the true story chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s critically acclaimed book Into Thin Air, a team of climbers set out to summit the monolithic mountain. Plagued by the ghosts of those claimed by the journey, they endeavor to join the hallowed ranks of adventurers to have conquered the peak.

In Rachmaninov’s Aleko, a man abandons a life in Russian society to join his love, the fiercely independent Zemfira, and her free spirited camp of Romani travelers. When Zemfira refuses to settle down with just one lover, Aleko is faced with a choice: adapt to this new life, or face tragic consequences.

B2WGBhtq6gyb2QEK2Q,The Peanuts Papers,community,"The Peanuts Papers is a one-of-a-kind celebration of America’s beloved comic strip—and the life lessons it can teach us—from a stellar array of writers and artists. Join us for a fun-filled night of Peanuts discussion and appreciation with Andrew Blauner, editor of the anthology, and Chris Ware, contributing artist and writer. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About The Peanuts Papers: Charlie Brown, Snoopy & The Gang, and the Meaning of Life (Library of America; Oct. 22, 2019)

Over the span of fifty years, Charles M. Schulz created a comic strip that is one of the indisputable glories of American popular culture—hilarious, poignant, inimitable. Some twenty years after the last strip appeared, the characters Schulz brought to life in Peanuts continue to resonate with millions of fans, their beguiling four-panel adventures and television escapades offering lessons about happiness, friendship, disappointment, childhood, and life itself.

In The Peanuts Papers, thirty-three writers and artists reflect on the deeper truths of Schulz’s deceptively simple comic, its impact on their lives and art and on the broader culture. These enchanting, affecting, and often quite personal essays show just how much Peanuts means to its many admirers—and the ways it invites us to ponder, in the words of Sarah Boxer, “how to survive and still be a decent human being” in an often bewildering world. Featuring essays, memoirs, poems, and two original comic strips, here is the ultimate reader’s companion for every Peanuts fan.

Contributing writers and artists include Sarah Boxer, Jonathan Franzen, Ira Glass, Chuck Klosterman, Jonathan Lethem, Ann Patchett, Nicole Rudick, George Saunders, and many more.

ANDREW BLAUNER is an editor, writer, and the founder of Blauner Books Literary Agency. As an anthologist, he has edited eight collections including Coach: 25 Writers Reflect on People Who Made a Difference, Our Boston: Writers Celebrate the City They Love, and In Their Lives: Great Writers on Great Beatles Songs. He is also the co-editor of For the Love of Baseball: A Celebration of the Game that Connects Us All. His writing has been published in the New York Times, and he has appeared on a wide array of media outlets. He is a member of PEN American Center, National Book Critics Circle, The Authors Guild, Association of Authors’ Representatives and the Society of American Baseball Research.

EkXrASvHt6qGLFgpP7,-9:30pm and 11:30pm- After Dark A Von Freeman Tribute,community,"Jazz icon Von Freeman held forth from the stage of Andy’s Jazz Club every month for decades. After Dark A Tribute To Von Freeman brings together three of the top saxophonists on the Chicago scene today to celebrate Vonski’s legacy and the jazz artists he loved most: Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Charlie Parker. Vonski’s longtime guitarist Michael Allemana leads the all-star rhythm section.

Saxophones-Geof Bradfield-Rajiv Halim-Scott Burns, Guitar-Michael Allemana, Bass-Dennis Carroll, Drums-Dana Hall

Von ""Vonski"" Freeman was an American hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist who began playing with his brothers George Freeman on guitar and Eldridge ""Bruz"" Freeman on drums at the Pershing Hotel Ballroom. Various leading jazzmen such as Charlie Parker, Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie played there with the Freemans as the backing band. In the early 1950s, Von played in Sun Ra's band.  Freeman was considered a founder of the ""Chicago School"" of jazz tenorists. His music has been described as ""wonderfully swinging and dramatic"" featuring a ""large rich sound"".  ""Vonski"", as he was known by his jazz fans, was selected to receive the nation's highest jazz honor, the NEA Jazz Masters award.

He can be seen performing with long time Chicago guitarist George Freeman in the George Freeman/Mike Allemana Organ Quartet featuring legendary drummer, Bernard Purdie, and has been a steady presence every Saturday night for the past 17 years at the Green Mill Lounge, currently playing with saxophonist Pat Mallinger and a rotating ensemble of Chicago’s top musicians.

You will have the chance to learn from ISO/TC 194 representatives about the latest requirements and methods available to ensure they maintain compliance. Professionals within the biocompatibility industry will benefit from the conference's focus on industry hot topics, such as skin sensitivity testing, animal welfare requirements, blood interactions and toxicokinetic study design for degradation products and leachables.

Throughout the conference, there will be plenty of opportunities to network with like-minded peers and experts in the field, to develop and deepen their knowledge of biocompatibility testing and evaluations.

In addition to the conference, a pre-conference workshop will be run to take those new to the industry, or requiring a refresher, through the fundamentals of biocompatibility.

In 2012 his trio was invited by the Chicago Mayor's office to perform for the Nobel Peace Prize dinner in Chicago, where invited guests included U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gorbachev. Also in 2012, Andy's trio was hired by the U.S. State Department to provide music for the opening night gala at the NATO summit held in Chicago.

As a sideman he has performed with internationally know jazz musicians including Howard Alden, Harry Allen, Warren Vache, Ken Peplowski, Hod O’Brien, Anat Cohen, Kurt Elling, and Joe Cohn as well as many others.

""An uncommonly good player, with a modesty that brings to mind the fine Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert and a warmth suggestive of Joe Pass...has a gift for melody and plenty of rhythmic confidence...projects a naturalness when phrasing, and his overall intelligence makes understatement and subtlety virtues."" - Frank-John Hadley, Downbeat Magazine.

Vonski’s longtime guitarist Michael Allemana leads the all-star rhythm section.

Saxophones-Geof Bradfield-Rajiv Halim-Scott Burns, Guitar-Michael Allemana, Bass-Dennis Carroll, Drums-Dana Hall

Von ""Vonski"" Freeman was an American hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist who began playing with his brothers George Freeman on guitar and Eldridge ""Bruz"" Freeman on drums at the Pershing Hotel Ballroom. Various leading jazzmen such as Charlie Parker, Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie played there with the Freemans as the backing band. In the early 1950s, Von played in Sun Ra's band.  Freeman was considered a founder of the ""Chicago School"" of jazz tenorists. His music has been described as ""wonderfully swinging and dramatic"" featuring a ""large rich sound"".  ""Vonski"", as he was known by his jazz fans, was selected to receive the nation's highest jazz honor, the NEA Jazz Masters award.

One of Freeman's major contributions was his mentoring of countless younger musicians as well as his steadfast support of what he liked to call ""hardcore jazz"".  Freeman's quartet played every second Saturday of the month at Andy's Jazz Club with his longtime trio of sidemen composed of drummer Michael Raynor, guitarist Mike Allemana and bassist Matt Ferguson.

j9UNvg7G38BfQb9q9y,Watson Adventures’ Wizard School Scavenger Hunt for Harry Potter Fans,community,"Follow in the footsteps of young wizards on a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago, in search of art that echoes characters, places and enchanted objects in the famed Harry Potter books and movies. Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor.  The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art. Kids must be accompanied by an adult, but all-adult teams can compete separately. Price includes museum admission. Advance purchase is required. Questions?

zQWvLRFfq4wdKQKMT9,--5:00pm and 7:00pm-- Pete Benson Organ Trio,community,"One of Chicago’s premiere Hammond B3 players, Pete Benson has been in-demand as both a pianist and organist for over 20 years. Voted one of the top jazz organists for Down Beat magazine’s Rising Star Critics Poll seven years running, Pete can be heard weekly at Andy’s Jazz Club with his organ trio, performing a varied repertoire inspired by organ greats such as Larry Young and Melvin Rhyne along with standards by Thelonious Monk, Horace Silver, and Roland Kirk, to name a few.

Born in Sycamore, Illinois, Pete developed a love for music at an early age. He began his studies on a piano designed by his grandfather, a piano and organ designer for Wurlitzer. Pete maintains a busy performance schedule and continues to be on the forefront of the Chicago jazz scene. He can be seen performing with long time Chicago guitarist George Freeman in the George Freeman/Mike Allemana Organ Quartet featuring legendary drummer, Bernard Purdie, and has been a steady presence every Saturday night for the past 17 years at the Green Mill Lounge, currently playing with saxophonist Pat Mallinger and a rotating ensemble of Chicago’s top musicians.

KrnALNxyrxSsXNvZy9,National Theatre Live Presents A Midsummer Night's Dream,performing-arts,"A Midsummer Night’s Dream - captured live during its run at the Bridge Theatre will be released to cinemas 17 October with  National Theatre Live.
 
A feuding fairy King and Queen of the forest cross paths with four runaway lovers and a troupe of actors trying to rehearse a play. As their dispute grows, the magical royal couple meddle with mortal lives leading to love triangles, mistaken identities and transformations… with hilarious, but dark consequences.
 
Shakespeare’s most famous romantic comedy will be captured live from the Bridge Theatre in London. Gwendoline Christie (Game of Thrones), Oliver Chris (Green Wing, NT Live: Young Marx), David Moorst (NT Live: Allelujah!) and Hammed Animashaun (The Barber Shop Chronicles) lead the cast as Titania, Oberon, Puck and Bottom.

This production re-unites the team responsible for last year’s smash hit Julius Caesar including Tony and Olivier award winning director Nicholas Hytner (The History Boys, One Man Two Guvnors). The Bridge Theatre once again become a forest – a dream world of flying fairies, contagious fogs and moonlight revels, surrounded by a roving audience following the action on foot.
 
National Theatre Live captures live performances from the UK, celebrating it's 10th anniversary this year. Over ten years, NT Live has shown over 80 theatre productions in 3500 venues worldwide, reaching an overall audience of nearly 9 million people. NT Live currently screens in 2500 venues across 65 countries.

National Theatre Live is the closest thing audiences have to experiencing the feeling of actually sitting in the theater. Broadcasts retain the feeling of a live performance and though each broadcast is filmed in front of a live audience in the theatre, cameras are carefully positioned throughout the auditorium to ensure that cinema audiences get the ‘best seat in the house.’",10800,2019-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,2019-10-17 03:00:00+00:00,,2019-10-11 05:19:54+00:00,['performing-arts'],"[-87.628171, 41.884929]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': 'BuNgMhhjFrZYdJJ6V5Hjhv', 'name': 'Gene Siskel Film Center', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '164 North State Street\nChicago, IL 60601\nUnited States of America'}]",38,22,30,

In 2012 his trio was invited by the Chicago Mayor's office to perform for the Nobel Peace Prize dinner in Chicago, where invited guests included U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gorbachev.

He has also worked with many names on the Chicago jazz scene at nearly every spot that features live jazz music including Russ Phillips, Don Stiernberg, Kim Cusack, Chris Foreman, Bobby Lewis, Chuck Hedges, Judy Roberts, and Howard Levy.

""An uncommonly good player, with a modesty that brings to mind the fine Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert and a warmth suggestive of Joe Pass...has a gift for melody and plenty of rhythmic confidence...projects a naturalness when phrasing, and his overall intelligence makes understatement and subtlety virtues."" - Frank-John Hadley, Downbeat Magazine.

kpCBBBhXVS3Pt925Gh,-9:30pm and 11:30pm- After Dark A Von Freeman Tribute,community,"Jazz icon Von Freeman held forth from the stage of Andy’s Jazz Club every month for decades. After Dark A Tribute To Von Freeman brings together three of the top saxophonists on the Chicago scene today to celebrate Vonski’s legacy and the jazz artists he loved most: Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Charlie Parker. Vonski’s longtime guitarist Michael Allemana leads the all-star rhythm section.

Saxophones-Geof Bradfield-Rajiv Halim-Scott Burns, Guitar-Michael Allemana, Bass-Dennis Carroll, Drums-Dana Hall

Von ""Vonski"" Freeman was an American hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist who began playing with his brothers George Freeman on guitar and Eldridge ""Bruz"" Freeman on drums at the Pershing Hotel Ballroom. Various leading jazzmen such as Charlie Parker, Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie played there with the Freemans as the backing band. In the early 1950s, Von played in Sun Ra's band.  Freeman was considered a founder of the ""Chicago School"" of jazz tenorists. His music has been described as ""wonderfully swinging and dramatic"" featuring a ""large rich sound"".  ""Vonski"", as he was known by his jazz fans, was selected to receive the nation's highest jazz honor, the NEA Jazz Masters award.

One of Freeman's major contributions was his mentoring of countless younger musicians as well as his steadfast support of what he liked to call ""hardcore jazz"".  Freeman's quartet played every second Saturday of the month at Andy's Jazz Club with his longtime trio of sidemen composed of drummer Michael Raynor, guitarist Mike Allemana and bassist Matt Ferguson.

Thursday-Saturday, October 10-12, 2019

1306 S Michigan Ave

*Post Performance Conversation: Thursday, October 10

a conversation immediately following the performance with the artists

“Black pain is very profitable in this country; we are focused on black joy.” -d. Sabela grimes

Keeping with this seasons idea of creating and fostering of connection through dance, the Presenting Series is excited to present d. Sabela grimes. After years as a company member with hip-hop pioneer Rennie Harris, grimes has developed a movement system derived from black vernacular social-dance practices, music, activism, and their interconnectedness. ELECTROGYNOUS imagines the inclusion of liberated Black bodies at the celebratory center of the work. Featuring video art by Meena Murugesan and digital illustration by Mr. Maxx Moses, ELECTROGYNOUS brings new speculative realities to the stage.

About the Dance Center: The Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago is the city’s leading presenter of contemporary dance, showcasing artists of regional, national and international significance. The Dance Center has been named “Chicago’s Best Dance Theatre” by Chicago magazine, “Best Dance Venue” by the Chicago Reader and Chicago’s top dance venue by Newcity, and Time Out Chicago cited it as “…consistently offering one of Chicago’s strongest lineups of contemporary and experimental touring dance companies.” The Dance Presenting Series recently celebrated 45 years of presenting contemporary dance in Chicago.

About d. Sabela grimes:

d. Sabela grimes, 2017 County of Los Angeles Performing Arts Fellow and 2014 United States Artists RockefellerFellow, is a trans-media storyteller, sonic ARKivist, movement composer cultivating a devoted interest in Afrobiquitous life practices. Sabela has conceived, written, scored, choreographed and produced several dancetheater works including BulletProof Deli, plus Philly XP, World War WhatEver, and 40 Acres & A Microchip:Salvation or Servitude from his EXPERIMENT EARTH sound-movement triptych. Recent creative projects include, ELECTROGYNOUS (2017) and Dark Matter Messages (2018). ELECTROGYNOUS is a dance theater experience which articulates that Black gender qualities are infinite, multidimensional and distinct manifestations of wombniversal consciousness. Moved by how Octavia E. Butler invents interrelated

notions of humanness+otherness in her Parable Series, Dark Matter Messages dreams Butler's unfinished manuscript, Parable of theTrickster, into an experience that realizes quantum Blackness as a means to play within the nowness of imminent futures. On faculty at USC’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, he continues to cultivate, Funkamental MediKinetics,a movement system he created that focuses on the methodical dance training and community building elements evident in Hip Hop, Black vernacular and Street dance forms. Sabela loves pancakes, speculative fiction and his kinfolk. dsabelagrimes.com

Funding Credit:

The Dance Center presentation of d. Sabela grimes is made possible by the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project, with lead funding from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

“Black pain is very profitable in this country; we are focused on black joy.” -d. Sabela grimes

Keeping with this seasons idea of creating and fostering of connection through dance, the Presenting Series is excited to present d. Sabela grimes. After years as a company member with hip-hop pioneer Rennie Harris, grimes has developed a movement system derived from black vernacular social-dance practices, music, activism, and their interconnectedness. ELECTROGYNOUS imagines the inclusion of liberated Black bodies at the celebratory center of the work. Featuring video art by Meena Murugesan and digital illustration by Mr. Maxx Moses, ELECTROGYNOUS brings new speculative realities to the stage.

About the Dance Center: The Dance Center of Columbia College Chicago is the city’s leading presenter of contemporary dance, showcasing artists of regional, national and international significance. The Dance Center has been named “Chicago’s Best Dance Theatre” by Chicago magazine, “Best Dance Venue” by the Chicago Reader and Chicago’s top dance venue by Newcity, and Time Out Chicago cited it as “…consistently offering one of Chicago’s strongest lineups of contemporary and experimental touring dance companies.” The Dance Presenting Series recently celebrated 45 years of presenting contemporary dance in Chicago.

About d. Sabela grimes:

d. Sabela grimes, 2017 County of Los Angeles Performing Arts Fellow and 2014 United States Artists RockefellerFellow, is a trans-media storyteller, sonic ARKivist, movement composer cultivating a devoted interest in Afrobiquitous life practices. Sabela has conceived, written, scored, choreographed and produced several dancetheater works including BulletProof Deli, plus Philly XP, World War WhatEver, and 40 Acres & A Microchip:Salvation or Servitude from his EXPERIMENT EARTH sound-movement triptych. Recent creative projects include, ELECTROGYNOUS (2017) and Dark Matter Messages (2018). ELECTROGYNOUS is a dance theater experience which articulates that Black gender qualities are infinite, multidimensional and distinct manifestations of wombniversal consciousness. Moved by how Octavia E. Butler invents interrelated

notions of humanness+otherness in her Parable Series, Dark Matter Messages dreams Butler's unfinished manuscript, Parable of theTrickster, into an experience that realizes quantum Blackness as a means to play within the nowness of imminent futures. On faculty at USC’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, he continues to cultivate, Funkamental MediKinetics,a movement system he created that focuses on the methodical dance training and community building elements evident in Hip Hop, Black vernacular and Street dance forms. Sabela loves pancakes, speculative fiction and his kinfolk. dsabelagrimes.com

In 2012 his trio was invited by the Chicago Mayor's office to perform for the Nobel Peace Prize dinner in Chicago, where invited guests included U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gorbachev. Also in 2012, Andy's trio was hired by the U.S. State Department to provide music for the opening night gala at the NATO summit held in Chicago.

As a sideman he has performed with internationally know jazz musicians including Howard Alden, Harry Allen, Warren Vache, Ken Peplowski, Hod O’Brien, Anat Cohen, Kurt Elling, and Joe Cohn as well as many others. He has also worked with many names on the Chicago jazz scene at nearly every spot that features live jazz music including Russ Phillips, Don Stiernberg, Kim Cusack, Chris Foreman, Bobby Lewis, Chuck Hedges, Judy Roberts, and Howard Levy.

""An uncommonly good player, with a modesty that brings to mind the fine Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert and a warmth suggestive of Joe Pass...has a gift for melody and plenty of rhythmic confidence...projects a naturalness when phrasing, and his overall intelligence makes understatement and subtlety virtues."" - Frank-John Hadley, Downbeat Magazine.

xaXfMLCbUR7MdQCwMe,-9:30pm and 11:30pm- After Dark A Von Freeman Tribute,community,"Jazz icon Von Freeman held forth from the stage of Andy’s Jazz Club every month for decades. After Dark A Tribute To Von Freeman brings together three of the top saxophonists on the Chicago scene today to celebrate Vonski’s legacy and the jazz artists he loved most: Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Charlie Parker. Vonski’s longtime guitarist Michael Allemana leads the all-star rhythm section.

Saxophones-Geof Bradfield-Rajiv Halim-Scott Burns, Guitar-Michael Allemana, Bass-Dennis Carroll, Drums-Dana Hall

Von ""Vonski"" Freeman was an American hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist who began playing with his brothers George Freeman on guitar and Eldridge ""Bruz"" Freeman on drums at the Pershing Hotel Ballroom. Various leading jazzmen such as Charlie Parker, Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie played there with the Freemans as the backing band. In the early 1950s, Von played in Sun Ra's band.  Freeman was considered a founder of the ""Chicago School"" of jazz tenorists. His music has been described as ""wonderfully swinging and dramatic"" featuring a ""large rich sound"".  ""Vonski"", as he was known by his jazz fans, was selected to receive the nation's highest jazz honor, the NEA Jazz Masters award.

One of Freeman's major contributions was his mentoring of countless younger musicians as well as his steadfast support of what he liked to call ""hardcore jazz"".  Freeman's quartet played every second Saturday of the month at Andy's Jazz Club with his longtime trio of sidemen composed of drummer Michael Raynor, guitarist Mike Allemana and bassist Matt Ferguson.

PMV8QVApzmcBiN6Ucf,-9:30pm and 11:30pm- The Trumpet Summit,community,"A collaboration between Andy's Jazz Club and Marques Carroll, The Trumpet Summit features the most in demand and on the rise trumpeters in the city of Chicago.  Showcased in the group are the three trumpets of Quentin Coaxum, Marques Carroll & Justin Copeland.  The band will be celebrating the music of the greats like Freddie Hubbard, Wynton Marsalis, Lee Morgan as well as original music from each individual Summit trumpeters.

For the diverse trumpeter who has spent the last 28 years of life pursuing music with dedication and determination, Marques Carroll has turned his passion into a career and a life long journey.  To say that Jazz is his only plateau would limit his overall playing ability and knowledge of music.  From what his father, graphic design artist and novice funk bassist, Mark Carroll, would say, “He would listen to everything, even when he was about 5 years old, but Jazz music is what caught his attention.”

During his time in Chicago, Marques became a first call sub for the Chicago Jazz Ensemble while under the direction of Dana Hall where he would play section or lead trumpet for the ensemble and perform with artists such as Christian McBride, Etienne Charles, Meshell Ndegocello and Nicholas Payton.

Marques continues to stay active in music education throughout the city of Chicago. Currently the Musical Director for the Chicago Jesuit Academy, Marques has written the course outline and curriculum in which students are exposed to jazz history, theory and instrumental pedagogy.

He can be seen performing with long time Chicago guitarist George Freeman in the George Freeman/Mike Allemana Organ Quartet featuring legendary drummer, Bernard Purdie, and has been a steady presence every Saturday night for the past 17 years at the Green Mill Lounge, currently playing with saxophonist Pat Mallinger and a rotating ensemble of Chicago’s top musicians.

5AQDRn4Giz7Lc547nc,--5:00pm and 7:00pm-- Andy Brown Quartet,community,"Andy Brown is a guitarist based in Chicago. Born in New York City in 1975, he has played professionally for over twenty years. He has had a varied performing career that has included stints in Cincinnati and New York.

In 2012 his trio was invited by the Chicago Mayor's office to perform for the Nobel Peace Prize dinner in Chicago, where invited guests included U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as the Dalai Lama and Mikhail Gorbachev. Also in 2012, Andy's trio was hired by the U.S. State Department to provide music for the opening night gala at the NATO summit held in Chicago.

As a sideman he has performed with internationally know jazz musicians including Howard Alden, Harry Allen, Warren Vache, Ken Peplowski, Hod O’Brien, Anat Cohen, Kurt Elling, and Joe Cohn as well as many others. He has also worked with many names on the Chicago jazz scene at nearly every spot that features live jazz music including Russ Phillips, Don Stiernberg, Kim Cusack, Chris Foreman, Bobby Lewis, Chuck Hedges, Judy Roberts, and Howard Levy.

""An uncommonly good player, with a modesty that brings to mind the fine Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert and a warmth suggestive of Joe Pass...has a gift for melody and plenty of rhythmic confidence...projects a naturalness when phrasing, and his overall intelligence makes understatement and subtlety virtues."" - Frank-John Hadley, Downbeat Magazine.

h4qZ4zhYSvFMm2VEvp,Keah Brown: The Pretty One,community,"Writer and disabled rights advocate Keah Brown presents her first book The Pretty One, a thoughtful, inspiring, and charming collection of essays exploring what it means to be black and disabled in a mostly able-bodied white America.

KEAH BROWN is the creator of the #DisabledAndCute viral campaign and a writer whose work has appeared in Teen Vogue, ESPNW, Harper’s Bazaar, and Marie Claire UK, among other publications.

Born with cerebral palsy, her greatest desire used to be normalcy and refuge from the steady stream of self-hate society strengthened inside her. But after years of introspection and reaching out to others in her community, she has reclaimed herself and changed her perspective.

In The Pretty One, Brown gives a contemporary and relatable voice to the disabled — so often portrayed as mute, weak, or isolated. With clear, fresh, and light-hearted prose, these essays explore everything from her relationship with her able-bodied identical twin (called “the pretty one” by friends) to navigating romance; her deep affinity for all things pop culture — and her disappointment with the media’s distorted view of disability; and her declaration of self-love with the viral hashtag #DisabledAndCute.",7200,2019-09-25 23:30:00+00:00,2019-09-26 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-08-17 06:48:46+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

rhGjEtaot8vjW8Q9ur,Profs & Pints: A Maritime History of Chicago,performing-arts,"Profs and Pints presents: A Maritime History of Chicago, with Ted Karamanski, professor of history at Loyola University Chicago, author of ten books on regional history, and a founder of the Chicago Maritime Museum.

Come take a deep dive into Chicago's watery background, and learn the fascinating details of how its economic development, layout, and infrastructure were shaped by Lake Michigan and the Chicago River. Let Professor Ted Karamanski, a scholar of the region who teaches budding historians how to engage with the public, take you on a fun and fast-flowing journey through the city's maritime past.

He'll talk about how the Chicago River developed from a route used by Native Americans on canoes to a chaotic harbor travelled by more than 100 ships a day, helping to establish Chicago as the busiest port in the nation and one of the busiest ports in the world in the late 1800s. A key route for grain and lumber destined for the East Coast and for Europe, it opened its bridges to let ships pass so often every day that Sorry, I was bridged became the most common excuse for commuting workers who showed up late for jobs.

You'll learn how the city, build on a flat, wet prairie prone to flooding, found its watery setting to be a challenge to its urban development. It responded with innovation, mounting a massive 19th-century effort to sit higher off the water, digging tunnels deep under Lake Michigan, ingeniously reversing the river's flow, and developing a massive system of lake-front parks and beaches that serve purposes beyond recreation.

Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor.  The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art.

zhszfuRAuuV96AGYKr,Deborah Blum: The Poison Squad,community,"Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times bestselling author Deborah Blum presents her new book The Poison Squad, which tells the dramatic true story of how food was made safe in the United States and the heroes, led by the inimitable Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, who fought for change. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About THE POISON SQUAD:

By the end of the 19th century, food in America was increasingly dangerous – lethal even. Milk and meat were routinely preserved with formaldehyde; beer and wine were preserved with salicylic acid, a pharmaceutical chemical; canned vegetables were greened-up by copper sulphate, a toxic metallic salt; rancid butter was made edible with borax, best known as a cleaning product. Food manufacturers had rushed to embrace the rise of industrial chemistry and were knowingly selling harmful products, putting profit before the health of their customers. Citizens began agitating for change.

In 1883, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemistry professor from Purdue University, was named chief chemist of the United States Department of Agriculture, and the agency began investigating food and drink fraud, even conducting shocking tests on groups of young men who came to be known as, “The Poison Squad.”

Over the next 30 years, a titanic struggle took place, with the courageous and fascinating Dr. Wiley campaigning tirelessly for food safety and consumer protection. Together with a gallant cast, including the muckraking report Upton Sinclair, whose fiction revealed the horrific truth about the Chicago stockyards; Fannie Farmer, then the most famous cookbook author in the country; and Henry J. Heinz, one of the few food producers who actively advocated for pure food, Dr. Wiley changed history. When the landmark 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act was finally passed, it was known across the land as “Dr. Wiley’s Law.”

Blum brings to life this timeless and hugely satisfying “David and Goliath” tale with righteous verve and style, driving home the moral imperative of confronting corporate greed and government corruption with a bracing clarity, which speaks resoundingly to the enormous social and political challenges we face today.

DEBORAH BLUM is director of the Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT, and publisher of Undark magazine. In 1992, she won the Pulitzer Prize for a series on primate research, which she turned into a book, The Monkey Wars. Her other books include The Poisoner’s Handbook, Ghost Hunters, Love at Goon Park, and Sex on the Brain. She has written for various publications including The New York Times, Wired, Time, The Guardian, Discover, Mother Jones, and The Boston Globe.

LdGH4dg8Wp9JP6PQsv,Archaeology From Space: Writing the Past and Future,community,"We’ve teamed up with our friends at the Adler Planetarium to present National Geographic Fellow and TED Prize winner Sarah Parcak, author of Archaeology from Space: How the Future Shapes Our Past. Parcak will be joined by Adler astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz to discuss the book and how we view ourselves from the ground and the stars. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About ARCHAEOLOGY FROM SPACE:

Dr. Sarah Parcak shows the evolution, major discoveries, and future potential of the young field of satellite archaeology. From surprise advancements after the declassification of spy photography, to a new map of the mythical Egyptian city of Tanis, she shares her field’s biggest discoveries, revealing why space archaeology is not only exciting, but urgently essential to the preservation of the world’s ancient treasures.

Parcak has worked in twelve countries and four continents, using multispectral and high-resolution satellite imagery to identify thousands of previously unknown settlements, roads, fortresses, palaces, tombs, and even potential pyramids. From there, her stories take us back in time and across borders, into the day-to-day lives of ancient humans whose traits and genes we share. And she shows us that if we heed the lessons of the past, we can shape a vibrant future.

SARAH PARCAK is a Professor of Anthropology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, CEO of Globalxplorer, and Director of the Joint Mission to Lisht (Egypt). Her remote sensing work has been the focus of three BBC specials covering Egypt, ancient Rome, and the Vikings. She is a Fellow in the Society of Antiquaries, a 2014 TED Senior Fellow, the winner of the 2016 TED Prize, and a National Geographic Fellow.

LUCIANNE WALKOWICZ, PhD, is the Baruch S. Blumberg Chair in Astrobiology at the Library of Congress, and an Astronomer at the Adler Planetarium. She studies the ethics of Mars exploration, stellar magnetic activity, how stars influence a planet’s suitability as a host for alien life, and how to use advanced computing to discover unusual events in large astronomical data sets. Walkowicz is the founding director of the new LSSTC Data Science Fellowship Program, an initiative to provide astronomy graduate students with training in advanced computing, and coordinates the community of science collaborations for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Walkowicz holds a BS in Physics and Astronomy from Johns Hopkins University, and an MS and PhD in Astronomy from the University of Washington. Walkowicz is also a TED Senior Fellow and a practicing artist, working in a variety of media, from oil paint to sound.",7200,2019-08-13 23:30:00+00:00,2019-08-14 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-07-20 03:56:45+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'science']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

u9vhPB4ntVpuqdSfze,Karl Marlantes: Deep River,community,"Bestselling author Karl Marlantes presents his new book, Deep River, a stunningly expansive family epic of human suffering, courage, and reinvention. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About DEEP RIVER:

In the early 1900s, as the oppression of Russia’s imperial rule takes its toll on Finland, the three Koski siblings — Ilmari, Matti, and the politicized young Aino — are forced to flee to the United States. Not far from the majestic Columbia River, the siblings settle among other Finns in a logging community in southern Washington, where the first harvesting of the colossal old-growth forests begets rapid development, and radical labor movements begin to catch fire.

The brothers face the excitement and danger of pioneering this frontier wilderness—climbing and felling trees one-hundred meters high—while Aino, foremost of the book’s many strong, independent women, devotes herself to organizing the industry’s first unions. As the Koski siblings strive to rebuild lives and families in an America in flux, they also try to hold fast to the traditions of a home they left behind.

Layered with fascinating historical detail, this is a novel that breathes deeply of the sun-dappled forest and bears witness to the stump-ridden fields the loggers, and the first waves of modernity, leave behind. At its heart, Deep River is an ambitious and timely exploration of the place of the individual, and of the immigrant, in an America still in the process of defining its own identity.

KARL MARLANTES graduated from Yale University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, before serving as a Marine in Vietnam, where he was award the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals. He is the bestselling author of Matterhorn and What It Is Like to Go to War. He lives in rural Washington.",7200,2019-08-07 23:30:00+00:00,2019-08-08 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-07-13 03:18:14+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

cW6MeuUbH43Km98f5H,J. Michael Straczynski: Becoming Superman,performing-arts,"Legendary science-fiction and comics writer J. Michael Straczynski presents his dazzling, new memoir Becoming Superman. For the first time, Straczynski tells his own story and reveals how the power of creativity and imagination enabled him to overcome the horrors of his youth and a dysfunctional family haunted by madness, murder, and a terrible secret.

Joe’s early life nearly defies belief. Raised by damaged adults – a con-man grandfather and a manipulative grandmother, a violent, drunken father and a mother who was repeatedly institutionalized – Joe grew up in abject poverty, living in slums and projects when not on the road, crisscrossing the country in his father’s desperate attempts to escape the consequences of his past.

Straczynski’s personal history has always been shrouded in mystery. Becoming Superman lays bare the facts of his life: a story of creation and darkness, hope and success, a larger-than-life villain and a little boy who became the hero of his own life. It is also a compelling behind-the-scenes look at some of the most successful TV series and movies recognized around the world.

For four decades, J. MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI has been one of the most successful writers in Hollywood, one of the few to forge multiple well-respected careers in film, television and comics. He is the founder of Studio JMS and is best known as the creator of the science fiction television series Babylon 5, Crusade, Jeremiah, and Sense8. Straczynski also wrote the psychological drama film Changeling, and co-wrote the films Ninja Assassin, Underworld: Awakening, and World War Z.

As a comic book writer, Straczynski wrote Marvel Comics’ The Amazing Spider-Man, followed by runs on Thor and Fantastic Four. He is also the author of the Superman: Earth One graphic novel trilogy and has written Superman, Wonder Woman, and Before Watchmen for DC Comics. He is also the creator and writer of several original comic book series such as Rising Stars, Midnight Nation, Dream Police, and Ten Grand through his own comic imprint Joe’s Comics. Straczynski is also the author of the novels Blood Night; Othersyde; and Tribulations, the short fiction collection Straczynski Unplugged, and the nonfiction book The Complete Book of Scriptwriting.

LwmnDvfx2j3wRvNhUA,Jasmine Guillory: The Wedding Party,community,"Bestselling author Jasmine Guillory presents THE WEDDING PARTY, her exhilarating new romance that has been selected as a Reese’s Book Club x Hello Sunshine pick. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

About THE WEDDING PARTY:
Maddie and Theo have two things in common: 1) Alexa is their best friend and 2) They hate each other.

After an ""oops, we made a mistake"" night together, neither one can stop thinking about the other. With Alexa's wedding rapidly approaching, Maddie and Theo both share bridal party responsibilities that require more interaction with each other than they're comfortable with. Underneath the sharp barbs they toss at each other is a simmering attraction that won't fade. It builds until they find themselves sneaking off together to release some tension when Alexa isn't looking, agreeing they would end it once the wedding is over. When it's suddenly pushed up and they only have a few months left of secret rendezvouses, they find themselves regretting that the end is near. Two people this different can't possibly have a connection other than the purely physical, right?

But as with any engagement with a nemesis, there are unspoken rules that must be abided by. First and foremost, don't fall in love.

JASMINE GUILLORY is the New York Times bestselling author of ""The Wedding Date,"" ""The Proposal,"" and the forthcoming ""The Wedding Party.""

4uXBqVkwfJekeZLKjf,Elliot Ackerman: Places and Names,community,"Marine war veteran and National Book Award finalist ELLIOT ACKERMAN presents his new memoir PLACES AND NAMES, an astonishing reckoning with the nature of combat and the human cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Books will be sold and signed at the program.

At once an intensely personal book about the terrible lure of combat and a brilliant meditation on the larger meaning of the past two decades of strife for America, the region and the world, PLACES AND NAMES bids fair to take its place among our greatest books about modern war.

By moving back and forth between his recent experiences on the ground as a journalist in Syria and its environs and his deeper past in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ackerman creates a work of astonishing atmospheric pressurization. He shares extraordinarily vivid and powerful stories of his own experiences in battle, culminating in the events of the Second Battle of Fallujah, the most intense urban combat for the Marines since Hue in Vietnam, where Ackerman's actions leading a rifle platoon saw him awarded the Silver Star. He weaves these stories into the latticework of a masterful larger reckoning, with contemporary geopolitics through his vantage as a journalist in Istanbul and with the human extremes of both bravery and horror.

ELLIOT ACKERMAN is the author of the novels 'Waiting for Eden,' 'Green on Blue,' and 'Dark at the Crossing,' which was a finalist for the National Book Award. His writings have appeared in Esquire, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and The New York Times Magazine, among other publications, and his stories have been included in The Best American Short Stories and The Best American Travel Writing. He is both a former White House Fellow and Marine, and served five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for Valor, and the Purple Heart. He divides his time between New York City and Washington, D.C.",7200,2019-07-17 23:30:00+00:00,2019-07-18 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-07-05 14:20:28+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

Rapoport Center for Education & Engagement, Goodman Theatre, Chicago Limited openings - all availability is on a first come, first serve basis. If registering before 11:59PM Central on April 12th, 2019, use code EARLYBIRD for discounted registration. Sojourn Theatre has been devising original work for almost twenty years. Documentary theatre about public education on the floor of a state legislature (Witness Our Schools); a site-specific adaptation of Brecht in a working Subaru dealership (Good); an interactive urban planning performance tackling gentrification at an international Arts Festival (BUILT); an immersive journey that brought urban and rural audiences across 50 miles to share a meal, conversation and a multi-generational tale of love and loss (On The Table); a participatory civic theatre event that engages strangers in the act of deciding how to spend real dollars on poverty reduction in their own community (How To End Poverty in 30 Minutes). We create gatherings that act like shows, processes that move like art, engagement that listens like relationship, and workshops that feel like discovery. Join Sojourn Theatre artistic director Michael Rohd alongside Sojourn ensemble members for three days of play, ideas, strategies and dialogue. Including explorations of movement and improvisation, facilitation and dramaturgy, generative activity and group practice, we will explore how to make work collaboratively that starts, grows, iterates and becomes. Sojourn and CPCP work to support and increase the capacity of artists and community organizations to imagine and collaborate towards racially equitable and economically just communities. This year we are able to offer a limited number of full and partial scholarships to offset tuition costs. If financial need is an obstacle to participation, please email sara@thecpcp.org for information on how to apply for a scholarship.

ABOUT THE UNION LEAGUE BOYS & GIRLS CLUBS 
Since 1919, the Union League Boys & Girls Clubs have been serving vulnerable youth in some of Chicago’s neediest neighborhoods. In 2017, the Union League Boys & Girls Clubs served over 14,000 youth members at seven well-equipped and professionally staffed inner-city Clubs that bring effective after-school programming to youth in the Pilsen, West Town, Humboldt Park, Bucktown, South Lawndale and Englewood communities.  The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs is a separate organization from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago; both are chartered by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs also serves Court-detained youth assigned to Juvenile Temporary Detention Program to reduce recidivism. The nonprofit staffs and manages its own 250-acre summer camp in southern Wisconsin where Club youth have a chance to enjoy supervised outdoor activities not easily accessible in an urban environment, as well as continue to develop healthy peer and adult relationships.

ujdzYvMkBL3Vcz5JwE,Sandra Cisneros & Fernando Flores,community,"The American Writers Museum presents an evening with Sandra Cisneros and Fernando Flores. Join us for this enlightening and inspiring conversation between one of America's most renowned writers and one of its new rising stars.

Fernando Flores's new book TEARS OF THE TRUFFLEPIG was listed as one of LitHub and The Millions' most anticipated books of 2019, and one of Buzzfeed's best books of Spring 2019. Cisneros said of Flores and the book, ""Funny, futuristic, phenomenal, Fernando A. Flores is from another galaxy. Fasten your seat belt. You are in for a stupendous ride.""

Written with infectious verve, bold imagination, and oddball humor, this debut novel is an absurdist take on life along the border, an ode to the myths of Mexican culture, a dire warning against the One Percent's determination to dictate society's decline, and a nuanced investigation of loss. It is also the perfect introduction for Flores: a wonderfully weird, staggeringly smart new voice in American fiction and a mythmaker of the highest order.

Flores was the recipient of a 2014 literary award from the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. His fiction and poetry have appeared in various publications since 2006, and was featured as one of Ten Writers to Watch in the October 2015 issue of Texas Monthly. He lives in Austin, Texas.

He's joined by writer and performer Sandra Cisneros, award-winning author of THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET, MacArthur Fellow, and founder of the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. She has won the Fifth Star Award, the PEN Center USA Literary Award, the Fairfax Prize, and the National Medal of the Arts awarded to her by President Obama in 2016. Most recently, she received the Ford Foundation's Art of Change Fellowship, was recognized among The Frederick Douglass 200, and won the PEN/Nabokov Award for international literature.

The conversation will be followed by a book signing by both authors. Books will be available for purchase from Seminary Co-op Bookstore.",7200,2019-05-16 23:30:00+00:00,2019-05-17 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-04-21 03:24:34+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

Jonah and Illinois Policy Institute CEO John Tillman will discuss the values that lifted humanity out of a 250,000-year cycle of poverty, hunger, and war and into prosperity, and how our current cultural and political moment is turning those values into vices. The conversation will explore how the miracle of modernity was created, how we're losing it - and what can be done to renew it.
Jonah Goldberg is a senior editor of National Review, a fellow at National Review Institute, and a fellow at American Enterprise Institute. He's the author of three New York Times bestsellers, including his most recent book, Suicide of the West.

3pKESy4nyLfCqGygU2,Gene Scheer: Moby Dick,performing-arts,"Learn how a classic novel was made into an opera with Grammy-nominated opera librettist Gene Scheer. He'll discuss the process of transforming Herman Melville's magnum opus ""Moby-Dick"" into a critically-acclaimed opera, finding parallels between writing classic literature and writing operatic verses. Combining musical performance and literary discussion, our Singers & Songwriters series takes visitors to the intersection of music, poetry, literature, and beyond.

This program is presented in partnership with the Chicago Opera Theater, which is putting on performances of ""Moby-Dick"" April 25th and April 28th. Featuring a sprawling chorus and massive orchestra, ""Moby-Dick"" is an epic feat of musical storytelling. This thrilling tale of adventure, passion, and vengeance is a not-to-be-missed event.

With the composer Steven Stucky, Scheer wrote the oratorio ""August 4, 1964,"" for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. The work was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for best classical composition. With Jennifer Higdon, Scheer wrote an operatic adaptation of ""Cold Mountain,"" which premiered in the summer of 2015 at the Santa Fe Opera. This work won the International Opera award, presented in London, for the best World premiere in 2015. Recently, along with Ms. Higdon, Scheer was nominated for a Grammy for his work on ""Cold Mountain"" for best classical composition.

Scheer’s work is noted for its scope and versatility. With the composer Jake Heggie, he has collaborated on many projects, including the 2010 Dallas Opera world premiere, ""Moby-Dick,"" starring Ben Heppner as Captain Ahab; ""Three Decembers"" (Houston Grand Opera), which starred Frederica von Stade; and the lyric drama ""To Hell and Back"" (Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra), which featured Patti LuPone. Other works by Scheer and Heggie include ""Camille Claudel: Into the fire"" and an operatic adaption of ""It’s a Wonderful Life.""",7200,2019-04-24 23:30:00+00:00,2019-04-25 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-03-17 03:34:41+00:00,['performing-arts'],"[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

ABOUT THE UNION LEAGUE BOYS & GIRLS CLUBS 
Since 1919, the Union League Boys & Girls Clubs have been serving vulnerable youth in some of Chicago’s neediest neighborhoods. In 2017, the Union League Boys & Girls Clubs served over 14,000 youth members at seven well-equipped and professionally staffed inner-city Clubs that bring effective after-school programming to youth in the Pilsen, West Town, Humboldt Park, Bucktown, South Lawndale and Englewood communities.  The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs is a separate organization from the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago; both are chartered by the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The Union League Boys & Girls Clubs also serves Court-detained youth assigned to Juvenile Temporary Detention Program to reduce recidivism.  The nonprofit staffs and manages its own 250-acre summer camp in southern Wisconsin where Club youth have a chance to enjoy supervised outdoor activities not easily accessible in an urban environment, as well as continue to develop healthy peer and adult relationships.

YG387NdpFSkyDUKXiw,Sloane Crosley: Look Alive Out There,community,"Bestselling author Sloane Crosley presents LOOK ALIVE OUT THERE, a brand-new collection of essays filled with her trademark hilarity, wit, and charm. The characteristic heart and punch-packing observations are back, but with a newfound coat of maturity. A thin coat. More of a blazer, really.

Fans of ""I Was Told There'd Be Cake"" and ""How Did You Get This Number"" know Sloane Crosley's life as a series of relatable but madcap misadventures. In LOOK ALIVE OUT THERE, whether it's scaling active volcanoes, crashing shivas, playing herself on ""Gossip Girl,"" befriending swingers, or squinting down the barrel of the fertility gun, Crosley continues to rise to the occasion with unmatchable nerve and electric one-liners.

And as her subjects become more serious, her essays deliver not just laughs but lasting emotional heft and insight. Crosley has taken up the gauntlets thrown by her predecessors―Dorothy Parker, Nora Ephron, David Sedaris―and crafted something rare, affecting, and true.

LOOK ALIVE OUT THERE arrives on the tenth anniversary of ""I Was Told There'd be Cake,"" and Crosley's essays have managed to grow simultaneously more sophisticated and even funnier. And yet she's still very much herself, and it's great to have her back―and not a moment too soon (or late, for that matter).

peMSBRKh7C3FRp55JE,Watson Adventures’ Wizard School Scavenger Hunt for Harry Potter Fans,community,"Follow in the footsteps of young wizards on a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago, in search of art that echoes characters, places and enchanted objects in the famed Harry Potter books and movies. Be prepared to track down flying owls, Hagrid-like giants, dragons that seem straight out of the Triwizard Tournament, and eerie figures as scary as any Death Eater or Dementor.  The hunt is not an addition to or variation on Harry’s adventures, but instead references to the books will provide a surprising bridge to many strange and wonderful works of art. Kids must be accompanied by an adult, but all-adult teams can compete separately. Price includes museum admission. Advance purchase is required. Questions?

92pwMtbKVXsejZi9mX,Timothy Hampton: Bob Dylan's Poetics,community,"Writer Timothy Hampton, a leading scholar on the history of poetry, presents his book ""Bob Dylan's Poetics: How the Songs Work.""  Hampton offers a unique examination of both the poetics and politics of Bob Dylan's compositions. Presented in conjunction with our special exhibit Bob Dylan: Electric. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

Focusing on the interplay of music and lyric, Hampton traces Dylan's innovative use of musical form, his complex manipulation of poetic diction, and his dialogues with other artists, from Woody Guthrie to Arthur Rimbaud. Moving from Dylan's earliest experiments with the blues through his mastery of rock and country to his densely allusive more recent recordings, Hampton offers a detailed account of Dylan's achievement.

Locating Dylan in the long history of artistic modernism, he examines the relationships among form, genre, and the political and social themes that crisscross Dylan's work. With this book, Hampton gives both a nuanced engagement with the work of a major artist and a meditation on the contribution of song at times of political and social change.

""This is a truly powerful book written by one of the leading scholars of the history of poetry today. The writing is clear and intellectually most exciting: Dylan's idiosyncratic genius is explained more compellingly than ever before. Hampton remains relevant, exciting and persuasively accurate as he shows the genesis of the songs as musical and literary forms and assesses their originality."" –Nigel Smith, Princeton University

Timothy Hampton teaches literature at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also directs the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities. He has written widely about literature and culture across several languages.",7200,2019-04-02 23:30:00+00:00,2019-04-03 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-03-08 05:05:40+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

QsiUCUUDiRjjEPzHkW,--5:00pm and 7:00pm-- Vocalist Keri Johnsrud,community,"Keri Johnsrud is a fresh and appealing jazz singer with a quietly expressive voice and a deep understanding of lyric interpretation. She is an important member of the jazz community with over 15 years of headlining appearances at some of the nation’s top venues, including Chicago’s historic Green Mill Cocktail Lounge and the Jazz Showcase, The Kitano and Cornelia Street Cafe in New York City, and Churchill Grounds and Velvet Note in Atlanta. Keri regularly tours the US with her own group and also lends her voice to several Chicago ensembles, including the critically acclaimed Shawn Maxwell’s Alliance.

For her latest record, Keri collaborated with GRAMMY nominated pianist Kevin Bales to release 'Beyond the Neighborhood: The Music of Fred Rogers', which has been selected as a Top 10 Jazz Album of 2018 by Cadence Magazine, All About Jazz, WDCB 90.9, and included in the NPR Jazz Critics Poll. Johnsrud and Bales have succeeded in reimagining and rearranging the music that has been heard by numerous generations on the beloved children’s television program Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. The songs, which up until now were specifically tailored for a child’s ear, are now presented as reinvented gems that are wise and wistful, simple but not simplistic, and even, in some cases, a bit sultry.

""If there is no struggle, there is no progress."" –Frederick Douglass

In many ways, the progress Douglass sought is still not fully realized, yet the struggle and resistance he helped establish continues. At this special event, Stauffer discusses Douglass's enduring legacy, as well as his continued relevance and how his words remain impactful in today's world.

John Stauffer is the Sumner R. and Marshall S. Kates Professor of English and of African and African American Studies at Harvard University. He is the author or editor of 20 books and more than 100 articles, which mostly focus on antislavery, social protest, or photography.

Quartet for the End of Time was written while Messaien was held in a prisoner of war camp in Germany, now in Poland, during World War II.  Fellow prisoners premiered the quartet outside in the freezing rain on January 15, 1941. The title of the work ""The End of Time"" not only refers to a representation of the apocalypse, but also musically to an end to traditional concepts of time.  Messaien was a contemporary French composer who drew inspiration not only from his connection to the Paris Conservatory and his life as a noted contemporary composer, but also from non-western influences from Japan and Indonesian Gamelan, and perhaps most notably in nature itself through birdsongs.
Introducing this epic quartet on the program are two contrasting works.  Vivaldi's Concerto in D Major, RV 84 is a light and charming baroque work that will be performed in a modern context on flute, violin, cello, and piano.  Chicago composer Seth Boustead's Three for Zhou B for flute, clarinet, violin, and cello will be performed with artwork displayed by celebrated contemporary Chinese-American artists the Zhou brothers, ShanZuo and DaHuang Zhou. Join us for this eclectic program that explores the light with the dark and everything in between.",7200,2019-03-16 20:00:00+00:00,2019-03-16 22:00:00+00:00,,2019-01-21 13:10:15+00:00,"['concert', 'music']","[-87.624869, 41.876452]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '33AY8zr5TjqT8yeHVmJucuR', 'name': 'Fine Arts Building', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '410 South Michigan Avenue\nChicago, IL 60605\nUnited States of America'}]",899,49,56,0.0

FZ5PxBzWUzouNZDyQ9,An Evening with Jonathan Lethem & Stacie Williams,community,"A conversation between Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of ""The Fortress of Solitude,"" and Stacie Williams, whose work ""Bizarro Worlds"" references Lethem’s characters and storylines to explore racism and gentrification. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

Named one of America’s greatest storytellers by the Washington Post, Jonathan Lethem's latest novel, THE FERAL DETECTIVE, is his first detective novel since ""Motherless Brooklyn"" and it delivers the same memorable delights: ecstatic wordplay, deeply felt characters, and a wonderfully offbeat sense of humor.

Lethem is The New York Times bestselling author of 11 novels, including ""The Fortress of Solitude"" and ""Motherless Brooklyn,"" winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. He co-edited the anthology ""The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick"" and the recently published Library of America anthology ""Shake It Up: Great American Writing on Rock and Pop from Elvis to Jay Z.""

Chicago writer Stacie Williams is the Director for the Center for Digital Scholarship at the University of Chicago. In her book BIZARRO WORLDS, she interrogates her own experience of gentrification and racism through the lens of Lethem’s superhero narrative, articulated in ""The Fortress of Solitude."" For Jonathan Lethem's characters, and for Williams in her own life, gentrification is a stand-in for racism—the ""Big Bad"" that affects education, policing, and housing policy. Williams's other work has appeared in Bitch Media, Midnight Breakfast, Literary Hub, New York Magazine, 
Catapult, Gordon Square Review, and The Rumpus.

Join us at the American Writers Museum for a conversation between these two exciting and talented authors. Books will be sold before and after the event.",7200,2019-03-15 23:30:00+00:00,2019-03-16 01:30:00+00:00,,2019-02-22 05:10:49+00:00,"['attraction', 'community', 'politics']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

XM9bwWhy9tFuZMQnTT,Bob Dylan in the 21st Century,community,"Co-editor Eric Hoffman presents the essay collection ""Tearing the World Apart: Bob Dylan in the 21st Century,"" which examines post-millennial Dylan. This event is in conjunction with our special exhibit Bob Dylan: Electric. Books will be sold at the event.

""Tearing the World Apart"" participates in the creation of the post-millennial Bob Dylan by exploring three central records of the twenty-first century--""Love and Theft"" (2001), ""Modern Times"" (2006), and ""Tempest"" (2012)--along with the 2003 film ""Masked and Anonymous,"" which Dylan helped write and in which he appears as an actor and musical performer.

No version of Dylan turns out uncomplicated, but the post-millennial manifestation seems peculiarly contrary--a tireless and enterprising antiquarian; a creator of singular texts and sounds through promiscuous poaching; an artist of innovation and uncanny renewal. This is a Dylan of persistent surrender from and engagement with a world he perceives as broken and enduring, addressing us from a past that is lost and yet forever present.

This collection of essays does justice to this difficult Bob Dylan by examining his method and effects through a disparate set of viewpoints. Readers will find a variety of critical contexts and cultural perspectives as well as a range of experiences as members of Dylan's audience. The essays in ""Tearing the World Apart"" illuminate, as a prism might, its intransigent subject from enticing and intersecting angles.

Eric Hoffman has published several collections of poetry. He is also the author of ""Oppen: A Narrative,"" a biography of poet George Oppen. He has edited or co-edited several essay collections, including ""Approaching Twin Peaks: Essays on the Original Series"" and ""Cerebus the Barbarian Messiah: Essays on the Epic Graphic Satire of Dave Sim and Gerhard."" He has also edited three volumes of the University Press of Mississippi's celebrated Conversations with Comics Artists series. He is co-editor of ""Tearing the World Apart"" along with Nina Goss.

Books will be sold before and after the event.",7200,2019-03-08 00:30:00+00:00,2019-03-08 02:30:00+00:00,,2019-02-10 04:24:30+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

BLK2RqgiWh92edN9KB,Resisting Hate with Free Speech,community,"A conversation with Nadine Strossen and Christie Hefner on the importance of free speech and how open dialogue and discourse can overcome hateful rhetoric. This event takes place at The Standard Club.

In her book ""HATE: Why We Should Resist it With Free Speech, Not Censorship,"" Nadine Strossen, former president of the ACLU, argues that expanding free speech, not limiting it, is the solution for changing the hearts and minds of those who espouse hateful ideologies.

Controversial speech is as old as America itself, from the passionate pamphlets and broadsides of the American Revolution to today's ideologically diverse media. Throughout our history we've grappled with how to engage with speech many find ""hateful,"" from white supremacist rallies to radical anarchist propaganda. Do we protect it, or do we restrict it?

U.S. law secures freedom even for hateful ideas, viewing this as essential for both individual liberty and democratic self-government. Would restricting the expression of these ideas promote the essential goals of equality, inclusion, diversity, and social harmony? Or could these restrictions actually do more harm than good? What can we learn from the experience of other countries in enforcing their anti-hate speech laws? How can we fight hatred with free speech, rather than censorship? All these questions and more will be answered during this discussion, moderated by Christie Hefner.

Many are familiar with Hefner as the Chairman and CEO of Playboy Enterprises, Inc., but she is also a passionate advocate of freedom of expression, social justice and equal rights and opportunities for women. She was the first woman elected to the Chicago Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization, and is a founder of the Chicago Chapter of Women Corporate Directors which works to increase the number of women serving on corporate boards. She presently serves on the Civic Advisory Committee of the Better Government Association and the board of the D.C.-based Center for American Progress Action, the leading progressive public policy think tank.

Strossen is the John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law at New York Law School. She has written, taught, and advocated extensively in the areas of constitutional law and civil liberties, including through frequent media interviews. She served as President of the American Civil Liberties Union, the first woman to head the nation’s largest and oldest civil liberties organization.",7200,2019-02-27 00:30:00+00:00,2019-02-27 02:30:00+00:00,,2019-01-25 05:39:06+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.62887, 41.877705]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': 'rdMzbRXFfxxFsHrdmzvxMZ', 'name': 'Standard Club', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '320 South Plymouth Court\nChicago, IL 60604\nUnited States of America'}]",34,21,29,

The Scarlet Ibis is a moving tale about brotherhood, nature and family. Doodle is different, and his Brother knows it. With the school year looming on the horizon, Brother decides it’s time to make Doodle just like all the other kids. As they run, jump, play, and row through the woods of North Carolina, a storm approaches that will change the lives of both boys forever. Called “an outstanding new chamber opera … a moving, intense, and dignified creation” by The New York Times, The Scarlet Ibis asks why we other those who are different from us, and what exactly it means to be “normal.”",0,2019-02-24 21:00:00+00:00,2019-02-24 21:00:00+00:00,,2019-02-18 03:12:02+00:00,['performing-arts'],"[-87.624869, 41.876452]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '33AY8zr5TjqT8yeHVmJucuR', 'name': 'Fine Arts Building', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '410 South Michigan Avenue\nChicago, IL 60605\nUnited States of America'}]",370,41,49,0.0

FRIENDS! The Musical Parody is the comedic musical that lovingly pokes fun at TV’s Friends, celebrating the adventures of your favorite group of 20-something friends as they navigate the pitfalls of work, life and love in 1990s Manhattan.

It’s a typical day at New York’s only coffee shop, Central Perk, until an unexpected runaway bride enters the picture and kicks the whole gang out of second gear! The new musical recreates our favorite moments from all 10 years of Friends through an uncensored, fast-paced, music-filled romp.

QXvJom2RuVDKx6Y2qy,"Daryl Sanders: That Thin, Wild Mercury Sound",community,"Music journalist Daryl Sanders presents THAT THIN, WILD MERCURY SOUND, the first book to tell the full story of the making of ""Blonde on Blonde,"" based on interviews with the producer, session musicians, studio personnel, and others. This program is in conjunction with our exhibit Bob Dylan: Electric.

THAT THIN, WILD MERCURY SOUND is the definitive treatment of Bob Dylan's magnum opus, ""Blonde on Blonde,"" not only providing the most extensive account of the sessions that produced the trailblazing album, but also setting the record straight on much of the misinformation that has surrounded the story of how the masterpiece came to be made. Including many new details and eyewitness accounts never before published, as well as keen insight into the Nashville cats who helped Dylan reach rare artistic heights, it explores the lasting impact of rock's first double album.

Based on exhaustive research and in-depth interviews with the producer, the session musicians, studio personnel, management personnel, and others, Daryl Sanders chronicles the road that took Dylan from New York to Nashville in search of ""that thin, wild mercury sound."" As Dylan told Playboy in 1978, the closest he ever came to capturing that sound was during the ""Blonde on Blonde"" sessions, where the voice of a generation was backed by musicians of the highest order.

Daryl Sanders is a music journalist based in Nashville and is one of the foremost authorities on the city's extensive rock and soul history. Sanders has been the editor of a number of magazines covering ""the other side of Music City"" dating back to the late '70s. While his focus has been on music coming out of Nashville, in a career spanning nearly four decades Sanders also has interviewed many legendary rock, soul, and jazz artists not associated with the city, including Frank Zappa, Tom Petty, Joan Baez, Billy Gibbons, Robert Palmer, J. J. Cale, Al Kooper, the Neville Brothers, Betty Carter, Gary Burton, John Handy, Ian Astbury, and Cassandra Wilson.

Attendees are invited to participate by exploring the arguments of each side and submitting their guilty or not guilty vote to literally tip the scale and make their verdict heard. Following highly-acclaimed successes with The NHM Trials of Socrates, Antigone, and The Parthenon Marbles, the National Hellenic Museum once again partners with prominent judges and attorneys to take on another case with ancient roots and modern consequences. The case Hippocrates, the father of medicine, was called to the bedside of the dying King of Thebes. The physician saw immediately that nothing could cure this illness. The King offered the physician a herd of horses for his care, which Hippocrates accepted, offering a potion for fever. The fever subsided, replaced by boils. Once again, Hippocrates said there was nothing to do, yet the King demanded treatment. Gold was given for a salve. Vineyards and a villa offered for a potion. Despite treatments, the King grew worse and died. Hippocrates was arrested and brought before the King’s son and heir. The National Hellenic Museum asks: did Hippocrates violate his own oath? Is he guilty or not guilty?

inHjtbygKiaTyKDVwL,Ross Gay: The Book of Delights,community,"Award-winning poet Ross Gay discusses and reads from THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS, his spirited collection of short lyric essays, written daily over a tumultuous year, reminding us of the purpose and pleasure of praising, extolling, and celebrating ordinary wonders. Books will be sold and signed at the event.

THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS is a genre-defying book of essays—some as short as a paragraph; some as long as five pages—that record the small joys that occurred in one year, from birthday to birthday, and that we often overlook in our busy lives. His is a meditation on delight that takes a clear-eyed view of the complexities, even the terrors, in his life, including living in America as a black man; the ecological and psychic violence of our consumer culture; the loss of those he loves.

Among Gay’s funny, poetic, philosophical delights: the way Botan Rice Candy wrappers melt in your mouth, the volunteer crossing guard with a pronounced tremor whom he imagines as a kind of boat-woman escorting pedestrians across the River Styx, a friend’s unabashed use of air quotes, pickup basketball games, the silent nod of acknowledgment between black people. And more than any other subject, Gay celebrates the beauty of the natural world—his garden, the flowers in the sidewalk, the birds, the bees, the mushrooms, the trees.

This is not a book of how-to or inspiration, though it could be read that way. Fans of Roxane Gay, Maggie Nelson, and Kiese Laymon will revel in Gay’s voice, and his insights. THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS is about our connection to the world, to each other, and the rewards that come from a life closely observed. Gay’s pieces serve as a powerful and necessary reminder that we can, and should, stake out a space in our lives for delight. 

Ross Gay is the author of three books of poetry, including ""Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude,"" winner of the 2015 National Book Critics Circle Award and the 2016 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award. ""Catalog"" was also a finalist for the 2015 National Book Award in Poetry, the Ohioana Book Award, the Balcones Poetry Prize, the Hurston-Wright Legacy Award, and it was nominated for an NAACP Image Award. He is a founding board member of the Bloomington Community Orchard, a non-profit, free-fruit-for-all food justice and joy project. Gay has received fellowships from Cave Canem, the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference, and the Guggenheim Foundation. He teaches at Indiana University.",7200,2019-02-20 00:30:00+00:00,2019-02-20 02:30:00+00:00,,2019-01-17 03:25:59+00:00,"['attraction', 'community']","[-87.624924, 41.885556]","[['6295630', '6255149', '6252001', '4896861', '4888671', '4887398']]",America/Chicago,"[{'entity_id': '3BRytup72rzM6eLmeE76faS', 'name': 'American Writers Museum', 'type': 'venue', 'formatted_address': '180 N.

6nkLaVfqeSUbM6VDyJ,Shannon Nichol Lecture : Ordinary Landmarks,conferences,"Ordinary Landmarks: Designing public spaces to reintroduce locally regular landscapes into communities
The modern mobility of humans and building supplies, computer-aided design and detailing, the sweeping scale of the vehicular age, and an industrialized nursery industry are among the factors contributing to the odd uniformity and over-scaled feeling in much of our built environment.
Landscape architecture has not been immune to the pressures in recent decades to “go big” or “world class” in order to register an effective visual impact within this challenging, grandly scaled setting. Citing several projects designed by GGN over the last 20 years – including the Lurie Garden at Millennium Park and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Campus -- Shannon Nichol will encourage “going small and going slow” to create a different type of landmark experience for both residents and visitors.
GGN’s work incorporates often-forgotten local ecologies and daily vernacular into prominent urban sites. GGN’s design process, which continues to heavily utilize hand-drawing as a design tool, will be shown, providing insight into a design firm working to retain complexity, idiosyncrasy, and natural nuance in the designed landscape. The importance of native plants, in resurfacing and repairing the unique, multi-thousand-year evolution of plants and animals in each place, will be discussed.
A handful of GGN's new monograph, GGN: Landscapes 1999–2018, will be available for purchase and autograph. There will be a small reception following the lecture for mingling and networking.

McNSk4G3zFNND5SmnF,Dave Eggers: The Monk of Mokha,community,"The American Writers Museum presents an evening at The Standard Club with bestselling author Dave Eggers and Mokhtar Alkhanshali, the subject of Eggers’ book THE MONK OF MOKHA, a heart-pounding true story of a young man’s courageous journey following the American dream. Admission ticket includes book.

THE MONK OF MOKHA is a true story that weaves together the history of coffee, the struggles of everyday Yemenis living through civil war, and the courageous journey of a young man—a Muslim and a U.S. citizen—following the most American of dreams.

Mokhtar Alkhanshali grew up in San Francisco, one of seven siblings brought up by Yemeni immigrants in a tiny apartment. At age twenty-four, unable to pay for college, he works as a doorman until a chance encounter awakens his interest in coffee and its rich history in Yemen. Reinventing himself, he sets out to learn about coffee cultivation, roasting, and importing. He travels to Yemen and visits farms in every corner of the country collecting samples, eager to improve cultivation methods and help Yemeni farmers bring their coffee back to its former glory. And he is on the verge of success when civil war engulfs Yemen in 2015. The U.S. embassy closes, Saudi bombs begin to rain down on the country, and Mokhtar is trapped in Yemen.

Dave Eggers is the author of eleven books, including: ""The Circle;"" ""Heroes of the Frontier,"" longlisted for the International DUBLIN Literary Award; ""A Hologram for the King,"" a finalist for the National Book Award; and ""What Is the What"", a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and winner of France’s Prix Médicis Etranger and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize. His nonfiction and journalism has appeared in The Guardian, The New Yorker, Best American Travel Writing, and Best American Essays.

He is the founder of McSweeney's, the publishing company that distributes the Voice of Witness series of books, which use oral history to illuminate human rights crises around the world. He is the co-founder of 826 National, a network of youth writing and tutoring centers with locations around the country, and ScholarMatch, which connects donors with students to make college accessible. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and his work has been translated into forty-two languages. He lives in Northern California with his family.

THIS EVENT TAKES PLACE AT THE STANDARD CLUB, 320 S. Plymouth Court, Chicago. Parking and other club information can be found at their website.

Take the trip with the team at Terrace 16, and find out. We will start the journey at the very north in Côte Rôtie and travel all the way down past Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

We will taste the following producers (North to South down the Rhône Valley):
M. Chapoutier, Côte Rôtie, “Becasses” 2007
Gilles Robin, Hermitage 2011 
Domaine Clape, Cornas, “Renaissance” 2012

qRrMJ7R9euMZqyYDBf,"Samira Ahmed: Love, Hate, & Other Filters",community,"Samira Ahmed presents LOVE, HATE, & OTHER FILTERS, her critically-acclaimed YA debut in which a Muslim teen copes with Islamophobia, cultural divides among peers and parents, and the perceptions of American identity. LOVE, HATE, & OTHER FILTERS was an instant bestseller & an IndieNext “Top Pick.”

American-born 17-year-old Maya Aziz is torn between worlds. There’s the proper one her parents expect for their good Indian daughter: attending a college close to their suburban Chicago home, and being paired off with an older Muslim boy who’s “suit able” to her mother. And then there is the world of her dreams: going to film school and living in New York City—and maybe, just maybe, pursuing a boy she’s known from afar her entire life who’s suddenly falling into her orbit at school.

But unbeknownst to Maya, there is a danger looming beyond her control. When a terrorist attack occurs in another Midwestern city, the prime suspect happens to share her last name. In an instant, Maya’s community, consumed by fear and hatred, becomes unrecognizable, and her life changes forever.

Samira Ahmed was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in a small town in Illinois in a house that smelled like fried onions, cardamom, and potpourri. A graduate of the University of Chicago, she taught high school English, helped create dozens of small high schools, and fought to secure billions of additional dollars to fairly fund public schools. She’s lived in Vermont, Chicago, New York City, and Kauai, where she spent a year searching for the perfect mango.

Samira will read from and discuss the book followed by signing.
